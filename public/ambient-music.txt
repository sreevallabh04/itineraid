# Ambient Music Instructions

## Important: 404 Error Fix Required
To fix the 404 error in the dashboard and complete the immersive experience of ItinerAid, you need to add an ambient music file with the filename "ambient-music.mp3" to this public directory.

## How to Add the Audio File:
1. Download a suitable ambient music track (see recommended sources below)
2. Rename the file to "ambient-music.mp3"
3. Place it in the public directory (same location as this text file)
4. Restart the server if necessary
